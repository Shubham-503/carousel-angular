# Project Name:  Config Driven Carousel

## Project Description

> A config-driven carousel
> Users can dynamically pass images, decide the number of images to be shown, set image limits, and determine actions to perform on image clicks.
> Responsive design with  dynamic option to change number of images
 

## Technologies Used

- Angular: Leveraged Angularâ€™s robust component-based architecture and lifecycle hooks (ngAfterViewInit and ngAfterViewChecked) to ensure proper initialization and updates.

- Responsive Design: Ensured that the carousel is fully responsive, adjusting the number of images per slide based on the available width.


## Challenges Overcome:

- Image Loading and Width Calculation: Implemented solutions to calculate image widths and handle layout adjustments dynamically correctly.

- Lifecycle Management: Managed component lifecycles effectively to ensure the UI updates correctly upon changes in data or view.

##  Next Steps: 
- I plan to continue enhancing this project by adding more customization options, including dynamic buttons, in future iterations.
